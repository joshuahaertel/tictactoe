# Tic-Tac-Toe
An intro to object oriented programming by making Tic-Tac-Toe. Includes notes from classes as well as the full source code.

# Setup
## Visual Studio Vode

1. Download VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/

1. Download and install the following plugins by opening VSCode and pressing `ctrl` + `p`. Then paste the following:

    | Plugin | Command | Purpose
    | - | -| - |
    | Sass/Less/Stylus/Pug/Jade/Typescript/Javascript Compile Hero Pro | `ext install Wscats.eno` | Transpile code for immediate use |

1. Ensure Auto Save is on:
    1. `File` -> `Auto Save`

1. (Recommended) Create an account at https://github.com/ in order to save your work in "the cloud"

    Note: As with everything on the internet, this account will be publicly available. Future employers will likely use it to see your previous. Take it seriously.

    1. After making your own account, head to this repo again at https://github.com/joshuahaertel/tictactoe
    1. Click the `Fork` button on top right hand of the page

1. Clone this repo (Note, this may require installing `git`. If the following instructions don't work, follow the instructions at https://git-scm.com/downloads and try again)
    1. When opening a new VSCode window, there will be an option that says `Clone Git Repositiory...`
        1. You can also press `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` and start typing `Git: Clone`
    1. Paste the URL of the repo into the text box that comes up. If you did not create a github account to save your work in the cloud, the URL will be `https://github.com/joshuahaertel/tictactoe.git`. Otherwise, the URL can be found by going to the repo on our you own account, selecting the green `code` button, and copying the `HTTPS` URL there. It will look the exact same except instead of the username `joshuahaertel`, your own username will be used
    1. Select a place on your local computer to save the project

1. Checkout a new branch
    1. In VSCode, you can press `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` and start typing `Git: checkout to` and press enter when the option shows up
    1. Start typing `Create new branch` (note: do not include the word `from`) and hit enter when that is the first option in the menu (this may already be the first option, in which case you can just hit enter)
    1. In the text box that comes up, labeled `Branch name`, type in a nickname, ie. `rugrat100` and hit enter

Congratulations! You now have a copy of this repo where you can save your own work!
