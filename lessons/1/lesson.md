## Instructions:
### Pong
The screen is a field. There are two brackets on each side of the field. There is a score in the middle. There is a ball. If the ball goes out on the sides, the person on the opposite side gets a point. If the ball touches the brackets it bounces off to the other side. If the ball touches the top and bottom of the screen, the ball will also bounce. When the ball touches a surface, it bounces off of it, 


### Tic Tac Toe
There is a grid with wto horizontal and two vertical lines such that there are 9 paces (3x3 grid). Player 1 is an x and player 2 is an O. Player 1 starts. A player makes a move by putting his symbol (X, or O) wherever he wants on the grid except on spaces that are already taken by x or o (already have a symbol). Player 2 then puts his symbol following the rules above. Then it repeats until P1 or P2 have their symbols 3 in a row/in a straight line. The player that got 3 in a row wins. When a player wins, the screen fills the words "win". If P1 and P2 don't get 3 in a row and there are no more spaces on the grid then the game ends. When the game ends (end being after the victory screen or the draw), then it restarts. When the game restarts the symbols on the board are erased. Afterwards, P1 starts as mentioned earlier.
