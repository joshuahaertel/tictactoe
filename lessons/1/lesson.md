## Instructions:
### Snake
Snake (Series of dots - initially 2 dots) grows (gets one more dot added to it) when it eats (the snake goes over) an apple (a single dot in a single spot). Each time an apple is eaten, a new one appears in a different spot on the screen. If the snake hits the walls (dots that form a square around the perimeter of a screen) the snake dies (disappears) and the game ends, the game starts over. A snake always moves in the same direction until the user hits a key OR the snake hits a wall.

### Tic Tac Toe
