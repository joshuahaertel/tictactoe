### Snake
Snake (Series of dots - initially 2 dots) grows (gets one more dot added to it) when it eats (the snake goes over) an apple (a single dot in a single spot). Each time an apple is eaten, a new one appears in a different spot on the screen. If the snake hits the walls (dots that form a square around the perimeter of a screen) the snake dies (disappears) and the game ends, the game starts over. A snake always moves in the same direction until the user hits a key OR the snake hits a wall.

### Tic Tac Toe
First two **players** _choose_ between **X** and **O**, one **player** _chooses_ **X**, the other **player** _chooses_ **O**. Then the two **players** _play_ on a 3x3 **grid**. Whichever **player** is **X** _goes_ first. The two **players** _take_ turns _putting_ their **X** or **O** on the 3x3 **grid**. The **goal** is for the first **player** to _reach_ 3-in-a-row, or 3 diagonally _wins_ the **game**.
